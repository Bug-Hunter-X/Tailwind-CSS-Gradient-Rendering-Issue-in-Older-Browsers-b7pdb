```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind CSS gradient classes.  The issue arises when the browser doesn't support the `linear-gradient` function, which can cause the gradient to not render correctly or display a fallback color.  This may lead to unexpected visual outcomes in older browsers or those with CSS processing limitations.
